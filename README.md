## Cloud-Services-Config
[Cloud-service-config](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config) is used to run Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console locally. RHEL for Edge/Fleet Management is part of Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. 

## Spandx
[spandx](https://github.com/redhataccess/spandx) is an HTTP switchboard. With it, you can weave together pieces of a large, complex website by choosing which resources should come from your local system and which should come from a remote environment.

For example, you could point spandx at your production site, but route `/static/js` to a local directory, which allows you to test your local JS against the production environment. Code in production, it's fun.

More technically, spandx is a flexible, configuration-based reverse proxy for local development.

## Patternfly
[PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) is an open source design system created to enable consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases. PatternFly provides clear standards, guidance, and tools that help designers and developers work together more efficiently and build better user experiences.

## Frontend-Components
[Frontend-components](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components) is a monorepo of Red Hat Cloud services Components for applications in a React.js environment. This repo uses a lot of components imported from the frontend-components repo using module federation.

## Module Federation
[Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) is a feature in Webpack that allows for sharing components outside a repo. When importing a component with module federation, the component is bundled with it's dependencies.

## Data Driven Forms
[Data Driven Forms](https://data-driven-forms.org/) converts JSON form definitions (schemas) into fully functional React forms with the provided set of features.

# Setup
Install all dependencies
Install NVM
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
```

source ~/.bashrc
```
Install version 16
```bash
nvm install 16
```
Use version 16
```
nvm use 16
```
install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Verify that node version should be 16.13.0 <= 16.13.1

## Running locally with webpack-proxy

Add `prod.foo.redhat.com`, `stage.foo.redhat.com`, `qa.foo.redhat.com` and  `ci.foo.redhat.com` to your `/etc/hosts` file (one time action). Follow this guide on [how to edit your `/etc/hosts file`](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/)

Your `/etc/hosts` file can look like:

```bash
127.0.0.1 prod.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 stage.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 qa.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 ci.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 qaprodauth.foo.redhat.com
```

To switch environment (for instance if you want to run your app with prod DB)
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=prod BETA=true npm run start:proxy
```
**Edge application will be available on https://prod.foo.redhat.com:1337/preview/edge/fleet-management**
